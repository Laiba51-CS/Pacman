<h1 align="center">PACMAN GAME </h1>


I have developed a C++ game that draws inspiration from the timeless classic, Pacman, while adhering to fundamental programming principles. The game introduces a player-controlled character represented by the letter "P," which can be skillfully maneuvered using arrow keys. Complementing the gameplay are ghost characters, symbolized by the letter "G," whose movements are dynamically generated, providing an element of unpredictability and excitement. Notably, one of the ghosts possesses the ability to track and pursue the player's character, intensifying the strategic aspects of the game.

The primary objective of the game is to guide the player's character to consume all available scores scattered throughout the game environment. However, caution must be exercised as the ghosts relentlessly patrol the area, posing a threat to the player's progress. Colliding with a ghost results in the loss of one of the three lives initially provided to the player. Should the player exhaust all three lives, the game gracefully concludes.

<ul>
  <li>Power pellets:</li>   Scattered throughout the game environment, power pellets can be collected by the player. When consumed, they temporarily empower the player's character, allowing them to turn the tables on the ghosts. During this time, the player can actively pursue and devour the ghosts, gaining additional points and clearing the path to collect scores.
  <li> Maze complexity:</li> The game features intricately designed mazes with various pathways and obstacles. Navigating through the maze requires strategic planning and quick thinking to outmaneuver the ghosts and efficiently collect scores. As the player progresses, the mazes become increasingly challenging, adding an extra layer of difficulty and excitement.
  <li>Bonus levels: </li>To provide a break from the main gameplay, the game includes bonus levels. These levels offer unique challenges or mini-games where the player can earn extra points or lives. Bonus levels provide a refreshing change of pace and reward skilled players who can successfully complete them.
</ul>

By incorporating these additional elements, including power pellets, complex mazes, and bonus levels, the game elevates the overall experience, providing more strategic choices, diverse challenges, and opportunities for the player to showcase their skills.
